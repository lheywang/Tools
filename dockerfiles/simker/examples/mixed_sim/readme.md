# Mixed_sim

This example was mostly designed as a proof of concept for the whole container, by mixing the highest number of tools.
Thus, it include : 
- GHDL to convert a VHDL file into it's Verilog equivalent
- Verilator, through Vlnggen to compile the digital logic into a logic equivalent
- Openvaf-r to compile the driver.va file into it's .osdi representation
- ngspice to simulate all of them.

The circuit is by itself quite simple : 

That's a clock, followed by a divider (factor 2), and then, a four bit counter. Each output is wired to an RC filter.
