# Tools
A repo git with all of my own Matlab / Python and other scripts.

They cover all of the stuff I'm doing as hobby / work / school (electronic design).

Feel free to use them, copy them, or modify them as you want.

## Notice :
All of the results that may be outputted by theses script may be wrong, without any notice for the end user. DO NOT USE THEM BLINDLY, and verify them with adequate tools (simulators...). Any issue with one of the results couldn't be assigned to my own responsibility.
